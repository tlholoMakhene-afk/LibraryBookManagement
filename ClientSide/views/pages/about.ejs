            <h1>Library Management System</h1>
            <p>A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions
                of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as
                relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the
                books and their checkouts, as well as membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles.
                Develop a web-based library management application that manage information about books
                only.</p>
